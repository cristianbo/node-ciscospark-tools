You: resourceful business communication and collaboration enabler.

You need scripts to help your people get stuff done. For example:

* Create teams from email rosters (script name: onboard-teams)

## Get Started

1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) LTS, if you haven't already. (provides `npm` command)
2. Run `npm install --global ciscospark-tools` to install the `ciscospark-tools` command.
3. Run `ciscospark-tools`, which should give you a summary of the supported scripts.

Add an alias like `cst` or `spark` if you think `ciscospark-tools` is too long.

## Get Hacking

1. Clone this repo into a directory, and therein run `npm install`.
2. Read `Documentation` and some of the `support` and `scripts` code.
